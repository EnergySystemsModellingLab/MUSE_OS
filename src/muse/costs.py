"""Collection of functions for calculating cost metrics (e.g. LCOE, EAC).

All costs functions take a subset of the following arguments:
- technologies: xr.Dataset of technology parameters
- prices: xr.DataArray with commodity prices
- capacity: xr.DataArray with the capacity of the technologies
- production: xr.DataArray with commodity production by the technologies
- consumption: xr.DataArray with commodity consumption by the technologies
- method: "lifetime" or "annual"

Data should only be provided for a single year (i.e. no "year" dimension in any of the
inputs). Prices, production and consumption data should be split across timeslices
(i.e. have a "timeslice" dimension). Technology parameters may also be specified at
the timeslice level, but capacity should not be.

The `technologies` input will usually contain data for multiple technologies and have
a "technology" dimension (sometimes called "asset" or "replacement"). In this case,
it's important that the `capacity`, `production`, and `consumption` inputs have a
similar dimension to ensure that costs are calculated for all technologies and to
prevent unwanted broadcasting.

Additional dimensions (such as "region") may be present in the inputs, but it's up to
the parent functions to ensure that these are consistent between inputs to prevent
unwanted broadcasting.

The dimensions of the output will be the sum of all dimensions from the input data,
minus "commodity", plus "timeslice" (if not already present).

Some functions have a `method` argument, which can be "annual" or "lifetime":

Costs can either be annual or lifetime:
- annual: calculates the cost in a single year
- lifetime: calculates the total cost over the lifetime of the
    technology, using the `technical_life` attribute from the `technologies` dataset.
    - In this case, technology parameters, production, consumption, capacity and prices
        are assumed to be constant over the lifetime of the technology. The cost in each
        year is discounted according to the `interest_rate` attribute from the
        `technologies` dataset, and summed across years.
    - Capital costs are different, as these are a one time cost for the lifetime of the
        technology. This can be annualized by dividing by the `technical_life`.
Some functions can calculate both lifetime and annual costs, with a `method` argument
to specify. Others can only calculate one or the other (see individual function
docstrings for more details).
