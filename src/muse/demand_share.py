"""Demand share computations.

The demand share splits a demand amongst agents. It is used within a sector to assign
part of the input MCA demand to each agent.

Demand shares functions should be registered via the decorator `register_demand_share`.

Demand share functions are not expected to modify any of their arguments. They
should all have the following signature:

.. code-block:: Python

    @register_demand_share
    def demand_share(
        agents: Sequence[AbstractAgent],
        demand: xr.Dataarray,
        technologies: xr.Dataset,
        **kwargs
    ) -> xr.DataArray:
        pass

Arguments:
    agents: a sequence of  agent relevant to the demand share procedure. The agent can
        be queried for parameters specific to the demand share procedure. For instance,
        :py:func`new_and_retro` will query the agents for the assets they own, the
        region they are contained with, their category (new or retrofit), etc...
    demand: DataArray of commodity demands for the current year and investment year.
    technologies: a dataset containing all constant data characterizing the
        technologies.
    kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

Returns:
    A DataArray of demand shares.

    r"""Splits demand across new and retro agents.

    The input demand is split amongst both *new* and *retrofit* agents. *New* agents get
    a share of the increase in demand for the investment year, whereas *retrofit* agents
    are assigned a share of the demand that occurs from decommissioned assets.

    Args:
        agents: a list of all agents. This list should mainly be used to determine the
            type of an agent and the assets it owns. The agents will not be modified in
            any way.
        demand: commodity demands for the current year and investment year.
        technologies: quantities describing the technologies.
        timeslice_level: the timeslice level of the sector (e.g. "hour", "day")

    Pseudo-code:

    #. the capacity is reduced over agents and  expanded over timeslices (extensive
       quantity) and aggregated over agents. Generally:

       .. math::

           A_{a, s}^r = w_s\sum_i A_a^{r, i}

       with :math:`w_s` a weight associated with each timeslice and determined via
       :py:func:`muse.timeslices.distribute_timeslice`.

    #. An intermediate quantity, the :py:func:`unmet demand
       <muse.demand_share.unmet_demand>` :math:`U` is defined from
       :math:`P[\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{A}]`, a function giving the production for a given
       market :math:`\mathcal{M}`, the associated consumption :math:`\mathcal{C}`, and
       aggregate assets :math:`\mathcal{A}`:

       .. math::
           U[\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{A}] =
             \max(\mathcal{C} - P[\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{A}], 0)

       where :math:`\max` operates element-wise, and indices have been dropped for
       simplicity. The resulting expression has the same indices as the consumption
       :math:`\mathcal{C}_{c, s}^r`.

       :math:`P` is the maximum production, given by
       <muse.quantities.maximum_production>`.


    #. the *new* demand :math:`N` is defined as:

        .. math::

            N = \min\left(
                \mathcal{C}_{c, s}^r(y + \Delta y) - \mathcal{C}_{c, s}^r(y),
                U[\mathcal{M}^r(y + \Delta y), \mathcal{A}_{a, s}^r(y)]
            \right)

    #. the *retrofit* demand :math:`R` is defined from the identity

       .. math::

           C_{c, s}^r(y + \Delta y) =
            P[\mathcal{M}^r(y+\Delta y), \mathcal{A}_{a, s}^r(y + \Delta y)]
            + N_{c, s}^r
            + R_{c, s}^r

       In other words, it is the share of the forecasted consumption that is serviced
       neither by the current assets still present in the investment year, nor by the
       *new* agent.

    #. then each *new* agent gets a share of :math:`N` proportional to it's
        share of the :py:func:`production <muse.quantities.maximum_production>`,
        :math:`P[\mathcal{A}_{a, s}^{r, i}(y)]`.  Then the share of the demand for new
        agent :math:`i` is:

        .. math::

            N_{c, s, t}^{i, r}(y) = N_{c, s}^r
                \frac{\sum_\iota P[\mathcal{A}_{s, t, \iota}^{r, i}(y)]}
                     {\sum_{i, t, \iota}P[\mathcal{A}_{s, t, \iota}^{r, i}(y)]}


    #. similarly, each *retrofit* agent gets a share of :math:`N` proportional to it's
        share of the :py:func:`decommissioning demand
        <muse.quantities.decommissioning_demand>`, :math:`D^{r, i}_{t, c}`.
        Then the share of the demand for retrofit agent :math:`i` is:

        .. math::

            R_{c, s, t}^{i, r}(y) = R_{c, s}^r
                \frac{\sum_\iota\mathcal{D}_{t, c, \iota}^{i, r}(y)}
                    {\sum_{i, t, \iota}\mathcal{D}_{t, c, \iota}^{i, r}(y)}


    Note that in the last two steps, the assets owned by the agent are aggregated over
    the installation year. The effect is that the demand serviced by agents is
    disaggregated over each technology, rather than not over each *model* of each
    technology (asset).
