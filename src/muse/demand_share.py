"""Demand share computations.

The demand share splits a demand amongst agents. It is used within a sector to assign
part of the input MCA demand to each agent.

Demand shares functions should be registered via the decorator `register_demand_share`.

Demand share functions are not expected to modify any of their arguments. They
should all have the following signature:

.. code-block:: Python

    @register_demand_share
    def demand_share(
        agents: Sequence[AbstractAgent],
        market: xr.Dataset,
        technologies: xr.Dataset,
        **kwargs
    ) -> xr.DataArray:
        pass

Arguments:
    agents: a sequence of  agent relevant to the demand share procedure. The agent can
        be queried for parameters specific to the demand share procedure. For instance,
        :py:func`new_and_retro` will query the agents for the assets they own, the
        region they are contained with, their category (new or retrofit), etc...
    market: Market variables, including prices, consumption and supply.
    technologies: a dataset containing all constant data characterizing the
        technologies.
    kwargs: Any number of keyword arguments that can parametrize how the demand is
        shared. These keyword arguments can be modified from the TOML file.

Returns:
    The unmet consumption. Unless indicated, all agents will compete for a the full
    demand. However, if there exists a coordinate "agent" of dimension "asset" giving
    the :py:attr:`~muse.agents.agent.AbstractAgent.uuid` of the agent, then agents will
    only service that par of the demand.

    r"""Splits demand across new and retro agents.

    The input demand is split amongst both *new* and *retrofit* agents. *New* agents get
    a share of the increase in demand for the forecast year, whereas *retrofit* agents
    are assigned a share of the demand that occurs from decommissioned assets.

    Args:
        agents: a list of all agents. This list should mainly be used to determine the
            type of an agent and the assets it owns. The agents will not be modified in
            any way.
        market: the market for which to satisfy the demand. It should contain at-least
            ``consumption`` and ``supply``. It may contain ``prices`` if that is of use
            to the production method. The ``consumption`` reflects the demand for the
            commodities produced by the current sector.
        technologies: quantities describing the technologies.
        timeslice_level: the timeslice level of the sector (e.g. "hour", "day")

    Pseudo-code:

    #. the capacity is reduced over agents and  expanded over timeslices (extensive
       quantity) and aggregated over agents. Generally:

       .. math::

           A_{a, s}^r = w_s\sum_i A_a^{r, i}

       with :math:`w_s` a weight associated with each timeslice and determined via
       :py:func:`muse.timeslices.distribute_timeslice`.

    #. An intermediate quantity, the :py:func:`unmet demand
       <muse.demand_share.unmet_demand>` :math:`U` is defined from
       :math:`P[\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{A}]`, a function giving the production for a given
       market :math:`\mathcal{M}`, the associated consumption :math:`\mathcal{C}`, and
       aggregate assets :math:`\mathcal{A}`:

       .. math::
           U[\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{A}] =
             \max(\mathcal{C} - P[\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{A}], 0)

       where :math:`\max` operates element-wise, and indices have been dropped for
       simplicity. The resulting expression has the same indices as the consumption
       :math:`\mathcal{C}_{c, s}^r`.

       :math:`P` is the maximum production, given by
       <muse.quantities.maximum_production>`.


    #. the *new* demand :math:`N` is defined as:

        .. math::

            N = \min\left(
                \mathcal{C}_{c, s}^r(y + \Delta y) - \mathcal{C}_{c, s}^r(y),
                U[\mathcal{M}^r(y + \Delta y), \mathcal{A}_{a, s}^r(y)]
            \right)

    #. the *retrofit* demand :math:`R` is defined from the identity

       .. math::

           C_{c, s}^r(y + \Delta y) =
            P[\mathcal{M}^r(y+\Delta y), \mathcal{A}_{a, s}^r(y + \Delta y)]
            + N_{c, s}^r
            + R_{c, s}^r

       In other words, it is the share of the forecasted consumption that is serviced
       neither by the current assets still present in the forecast year, nor by the
       *new* agent.

    #. then each *new* agent gets a share of :math:`N` proportional to it's
        share of the :py:func:`production <muse.quantities.maximum_production>`,
        :math:`P[\mathcal{A}_{a, s}^{r, i}(y)]`.  Then the share of the demand for new
        agent :math:`i` is:

        .. math::

            N_{c, s, t}^{i, r}(y) = N_{c, s}^r
                \frac{\sum_\iota P[\mathcal{A}_{s, t, \iota}^{r, i}(y)]}
                     {\sum_{i, t, \iota}P[\mathcal{A}_{s, t, \iota}^{r, i}(y)]}


    #. similarly, each *retrofit* agent gets a share of :math:`N` proportional to it's
        share of the :py:func:`decommissioning demand
        <muse.quantities.decommissioning_demand>`, :math:`D^{r, i}_{t, c}`.
        Then the share of the demand for retrofit agent :math:`i` is:

        .. math::

            R_{c, s, t}^{i, r}(y) = R_{c, s}^r
                \frac{\sum_\iota\mathcal{D}_{t, c, \iota}^{i, r}(y)}
                    {\sum_{i, t, \iota}\mathcal{D}_{t, c, \iota}^{i, r}(y)}


    Note that in the last two steps, the assets owned by the agent are aggregated over
    the installation year. The effect is that the demand serviced by agents is
    disaggregated over each technology, rather than not over each *model* of each
    technology (asset).
