"""Various ways and means to compute production.

Production is the amount of commodities produced by an asset. However, depending on the
context, it could be computed several ways. For  instace, it can be obtained straight
from the capacity of the asset. Or it can be obtained by matching for the same
commodities with a set of assets.

Production methods can be registered via the :py:func:`@register_production
<register_production>` production decorator.  Registering a function makes the function
accessible from MUSE's input file. Production methods are not expected to modify their
arguments. Furthermore they should conform the
following signatures:

.. code-block:: python

    @register_production
    def production(
        market: Dataset, capacity: DataArray, technologies: Dataset, **kwargs
    ) -> DataArray:
        pass


Arguments:
    market: Market, including demand and prices.
    capacity: The capacity of each asset within a market.
    technologies: A dataset characterising the technologies of the same assets.
    **kwargs: Any number of keyword arguments

Returns:
    A `DataArray` with the amount produced for each good from each asset.
