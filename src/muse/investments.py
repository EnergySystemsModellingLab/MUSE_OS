"""Investment decision.

An investment determines which technologies to invest given a metric to
determine preferred technologies, a corresponding search space of technologies,
and the demand to fulfill.

Investments should be registered via the decorator `register_investment`. The
registration makes it possible to call investments dynamically through
`compute_investment`, by specifying the name of the investment. It is part of
MUSE's plugin platform.

Investments are not expected to modify any of their arguments. They should all
have the following signature:

.. code-block:: python

    @register_investment
    def investment(
        costs: xr.DataArray,
        search_space: xr.DataArray,
        technologies: xr.Dataset,
        constraints: List[Constraint],
        **kwargs
    ) -> xr.DataArray:
        pass

Arguments:
    costs: specifies for each `asset` which `replacement` technology should be invested
        in preferentially. This should be an integer or floating point array with
        dimensions `asset` and `replacement`.
    search_space: an `asset` by `replacement` matrix defining allowed and disallowed
        replacement technologies for each asset
    technologies: a dataset containing all constant data characterizing the
        technologies.
    constraints: a list of constraints as defined in :py:mod:`~muse.constraints`.

Returns:
    A data array with dimensions `asset` and `technology` specifying the amount
    of newly invested capacity.
