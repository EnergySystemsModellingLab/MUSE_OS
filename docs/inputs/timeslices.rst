    This input file is only for legacy sectors, which are not part of the open source release. For time-slice settings in the open source release, please see the  :ref:`simulation-settings`.



Time-slices represent a sub-year disaggregation of commodity demand. They are fully
flexible in number and names as to serve the specific representation of the commodity
demand, supply, and supply cost profile in each energy sector.  Each time slice is
independent in terms of the number of represent hours, as long as it is meaningful for the
users and their data inputs. 1 is the minimum number of time-slice as this would
correspond to a full year.  The time-slice definition of a sector affects the commodity
price profile and the supply cost profile.

The csv file for the time-slice definition would report the length (in hours) of each
time slice as characteristic to the selected sector to represent diurnal, weekly and
seasonal variation of energy commodities, demand and supply, as shown in the table for
30 time-slices.

It reports the aggregation level of the sector time-slices (AgLevel), slice number (SN),
seasonal time slices (Month), weekly time slices (Day), hourly profile (Hour), the
amount of hours associated to each time slice (RepresentHours).
