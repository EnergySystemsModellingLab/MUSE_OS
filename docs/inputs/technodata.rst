Techno-data
===========
The techno-data includes the techno-economic characteristics of each technology such
as capital, fixed and variable cost, lifetime, utilisation factor.
The techno-data should follow the structure reported in the table. The column order
is not important and additional input data can alsobe read in this format. In the table,
the electric boiler used in households is taken as an example for a generic region, region1.


.. csv-table:: Techno-data: cost inputs
   :header: ProcessName, RegionName, Time, Level, cap_par, cap_exp, fix_par, ...
       
   resBoilerElectric, region1, 2010, fixed, 3.81, 1.00, 0.38, ...
   resBoilerElectric, region1, 2030, fixed, 3.81, 1.00, 0.38, ...


ProcessName
   represents the technology ID and needs to be consistent across all the data inputs

RegionName
   represents the region ID and needs to be consistent across all the data inputs

Time
   represents the period of the simulation to which the value applies; it needs to
   contain at least the base year of the simulation

Level
   characterises either a fixed or a flexible input type

cap_par, cap_exp
   are used in the capital cost estimation. Capital costs are calculated as:
   
   .. math::
   
      \text{CAPEX} = \text{cap$\_$par} * \text{(Capacity)}^\text{cap$\_$exp}

   where the parameter cap_par is estimated at a selected reference size (i.e. Capref),
   such as:
   
   .. math::

      \text{cap$\_$par} = \left(
         \frac{\text{CAPEXref}}{\text{Capref}}
      \right)^{\text{cap$\_$exp}}

   Capref is a reference size for the cost estimate decided by the modeller before filling the input data files.

   This allows the model to take into account economies of scale. ie. As `Capacity` increases, the price of the technology decreases. This does not include technological learning parameters, where prices may come down due to learning.

fix_par, fix_exp
   are used in the fixed cost estimation. Fixed costs are calculated as:
   
   .. math::
   
      \text{FOM} = \text{fix$\_$par} * (\text{Capacity})^\text{fix$\_$exp}

   where the parameter fix_par is estimated at a selected reference size (i.e. Capref),
   such as:

   .. math::

      \text{fix$\_$par} = \left(
         \frac{\text{FOMref}}{\text{Capref}}
      \right)^{\text{fix$\_$exp}}

   Capref is a reference size for the cost estimate decided by the modeller before filling the input data files.

var_par, var_exp
   are used in the variable costs estimation. These variable costs are capacity
   dependent Variable costs are calculated as:

   .. math::
   
      \text{VAREX} = \text{cap$\_$par} * \text{(Capacity)}^{\text{cap$\_$exp}}

   where the parameter var_par is estimated at a selected reference size (i.e. Capref),
   such as:
   
   .. math::

      \text{var$\_$par} = \left(
         \frac{\text{VARref}}{\text{Capref}}
      \right)^{\text{var$\_$exp}}

   Capref is a reference size for the cost estimate decided by the modeller before filling the input data files.

Growith constraints
   MaxCapacityAddition
      represents the maximum addition of installed capacity per technology, per year in a period, per region.

   MaxCapacityGrowth
      represents the percentage growth per year based on the available stock in a year, per region and technology.

   TotalCapacityLimit
      represents the total capacity limit per technology, region and year.

   .. csv-table:: Techno-data: growth constraints
      :header: ProcessName,	RegionName,	MaxCapacityAddition,	MaxCapacityGrowth,	TotalCapacityLimit

      resBoilerElectric, region1, 10,	0.2,	100

   In this example, MaxCapacityAddition,	MaxCapacityGrowth, and TotalCapacityLimit equal to 10 PJ, 0.2 (corresponding to 20 \%), and 100 PJ.
   Assuming a 5-year time step, the *MaxCapacityAddition* introduces a constraint on the maximum capacity which can be added in the investment year:
   it constrains the new capacity which can be installed in a modelled period as being equal to *10 * 5 = 50 PJ*. 
   The *MaxCapacityGrowth* applies a constraint on the capacity which can be installed in a modelled period, which depends on the
   decommissioning profile. Assuming that 7.7 PJ of resBoilerElectric is available in the year when the decision is made (investment year), and that 4.9 PJ of
   resBoilerElectric is available in the year at which capacities invested in, will be online, then the constraint applies as follows *7.7 * (0.2 * 5 + 1) - 4.9 = 10.5 PJ*.
   The *TotalCapacityLimit* applies a constraint on the maximum capacity of a technology in the investment year; it depends on the decommissioning profile and equals *100 - 4.9 = 95.1 PJ*. 

   Growth constraints are applied for each single agent in a multi-agent simulation. When only one agent is present, the growth constraints
   apply individually to the "New" and "Retrofit" agent, when present.


TechnicalLife
   represents the number of years that a technology operates before it is decommissioned.

UtilizationFactor
   represents the maximum actual output of the technology in a year, divided by the theoretical maximum output if the technology were operating at full capacity for the whole year.

ScalingSize
   represents the reference capacity at which capital costs are estimated when used as agents' objective as described in :ref:`inputs-agents`.

efficiency
   represents the technology efficiency used as agents' objective to sort investment according to their energy or material efficiency (see :ref:`inputs-agents`).

Type
   defines the type of a technology. This variable is used for the search space in the agents csv file. It allows for the agents to filter for technologies of a similar type, for example.     

Fuel
   defines the fuel used by a technology, defined to restrict the new investments of each agent to selected technologies using selected fuels (see :ref:`inputs-agents`).

EndUse
   defines the end use of a technology, defined to restrict the new investments of each agent to selected technologies using selected end uses (see :ref:`inputs-agents`).

InterestRate
   is the technology interest rate (called hurdle rates in other models).
   This is used for the interest used in the discount rate and corresponds to the interest built when borrowing money.

Agent_0, ..., Agent_N
   represent the allocation of the initial capacity to the each agent.
   The column heading refers each retrofit agent "AgentShare" as defined in the agents' definition (see :ref:`inputs-agents`).
   The value corresponds to the ownership of the initial stock, as defined in the :ref:`inputs-existing-capacity` for the starting year of the simulation. 
   For example, if an initial boiler stock of 10 PJ is available, this is allocated to each agent according to the "AgentShare".

   In a one-agent simulation, assuming that the *AgentShare* equals to *Agent_2" for the retrofit agent, the technodata should indicate the stock ownership as follows.
   The modelled agent would own the total 10 PJ of the initial stock of boilers.

   .. csv-table:: Techno-data: AgentShare - 1 agent
      :header: ProcessName, RegionName, Time, ..., Agent_2
         
      resBoilerElectric, region1, 2010, ..., 1
      resBoilerElectric, region1, 2030, ..., 1

   In a two-agent simulation, a new column neeeds to be added for each retrofit agent belonging to the new-retrofit agent pair.
   The column heading refers each retrofit agent "AgentShare" as defined in the agents' definition (see :ref:`inputs-agents`).
   Assuming a split of the initial capacity into 30 \% and 70 \% for each retrofit agent, the model table would be setup as follows.
   The values of the "AgetnShare" needs to reflect the demand split represented by the "Quantity" attribute (see :ref:`inputs-agents`),
   to make sure that the initial demand is fullfilled with the initial stock.

   .. csv-table:: Techno-data: AgentShare - 2 agents
      :header: ProcessName, RegionName, Time, ..., Agent_2, Agent_4
         
      resBoilerElectric, region1, 2010, ..., 0.3, 0.7
      resBoilerElectric, region1, 2030, ..., 0.3, 0.7
   
The input data has to be provided for the base year. Additional years within the time
framework of the overall simulation can be defined. In this case, MUSE would interpolate
the values between the provided periods and assume a constant value afterwards. The additional 
years at which input data are defined needs to equal for :ref:`inputs-iocomms`, :ref:`inputs-technodata`, and :ref:`inputs-technodata-ts`.

Interpolation is activated only if the feature *interpolation_mode = 'Active'* is defined in the TOML file.
