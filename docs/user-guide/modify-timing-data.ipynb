    "Timeslicing is the division of a single benchmark year into multiple different sections. For example, we could slice the benchmark year into different seasons, make a distinction between weekday and weekend or a distinction between morning and night. We do this as energy demand profiles can show a difference between these timeslices. eg. Electricity consumption is lower during the night than during the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we have to modify the ```settings.toml``` file, as well as the files within the preset folder: ```Residential2020Consumption.csv``` and ```Residential2050Consumption.csv```. This is so that we can edit the demand for the residential sector for the new timeslices.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we edit the ```settings.toml``` file to add two additional timeslices: early-morning and late-afternoon. We also rename afternoon to mid-afternoon. These settings can be found at the bottom of the `settings.toml` file.\n",
