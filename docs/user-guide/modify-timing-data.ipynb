    "Timeslicing is the division of a single benchmark year into multiple different sections. For example, we could slice the benchmark year into different seasons, make a distinction between weekday and weekend or a distinction between morning and night. We do this as energy demand profiles can show a difference between these timeslices (eg. electricity consumption is lower during the night than during the day).\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we have to modify the ```settings.toml``` file, as well as the files within the preset folder: ```Residential2020Consumption.csv``` and ```Residential2050Consumption.csv```. This is so that we can edit the demand for the residential sector for the new timeslices.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we edit the ```settings.toml``` file to add two additional timeslices: early-morning and late-afternoon. We also rename afternoon to mid-afternoon. These settings can be found at the bottom of the `settings.toml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the changes is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[timeslices.all-year.all-week]\n",
    "night = 1095\n",
    "morning = 1095\n",
    "mid-afternoon = 1095\n",
    "early-peak = 1095\n",
    "late-peak = 1095\n",

    "The total length of the timeslices should add up to 8760; the number of hours in a benchmark year. Whilst this is required, MUSE does not check and enforce this.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Next, we modify both Residential Consumption files. Again, we put the text in bold for the modified entries. We must add the demand for the two additional timeslices, which are numbers 7 and 8. We will also change the demand for `heat` in the existing timeslices.\n",
