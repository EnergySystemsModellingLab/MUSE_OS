    "In this section, we will add a new agent called `A2`. This agent will be slightly different to the other agents in the ```default``` example, in that it will make investments based upon a mixture of [levelised cost of electricity (LCOE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levelized_cost_of_energy) and [equivalent annual cost (EAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_annual_cost). These two objectives will be combined by calculating a weighted sum of the two when comparing potential investment options. We will give the LCOE a relative weight value of 1 and the EAC a relative weight value  of 0.25.\n",
