    "# Subsectors in MUSE\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous tutorial (_\"Adding a service demand\"_) we added technologies to the residential sector to service an additional demand for cooking. In this tutorial, we will use this model to explore a feature of MUSE that we haven't touched on yet: subsectors\n",
    "\n",
    "All sectors in MUSE have at least one subsector. For simple sectors servicing a single commodity demand, one subsector is all we need. For example, a power sector servicing just electricity would contain a single subsector (in previous tutorials we would have called this subsector `all`). Within the sector, MUSE will then set up a single optimization problem to meet electricity demands by investing among a set of electricity-producing technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the _\"Adding a service demand\"_ tutorial, we created a residential sector that produces __two__ demanded commodities: `cook` and `heat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is still possible with a single subsector (as we saw in that tutorial). In this case, MUSE sets up a single optimization problem to meet both `heat` and `cook` demands by investing among a set of `heat`-producing and `cook`-producing technologies. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, given that `heat` and `cook` are serviced by entirely independent sets of technologies, we could alternatively set up two distinct optimization problems: one to service `heat` demands by investing in `heat`-producting technologies, and another the service `cook` demands by investing in `cook`-producing technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by splitting the sector into multiple sectors, which will become clearer as we progress with this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several benefits of doing this. The first is computational, as MUSE now has to solve two simpler optimization problems rather than one larger, more complicated one. For this small example there may be no benefit of this (or the added overhead may outway the gains), but for larger sectors the gains can be substantial (particularly when the sector gets so large that the full linear problem cannot fit within the memory of your machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second benefit it that it allows you to specify different agent characteristics/objectives for servicing each commodity. For example, you may wish agents to minimise LCOE when investing in heating technologies, but minimise fuel consumption costs when investing in cooking technologies. We will explore this scenario below."

    "## Summary\n",

    "In this tutorial we have shown how to split a sector into multiple subsectors. In general, this is possible if the sector services multiple end-use commodities, and there are distinct groups of technologies that service each of these commodities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will not always be the case. For example, if there was a technology that serviced both `heat` and `cook` (such as an AGA), it wouldn't be possible to split up the sector in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to think about this for your own models, and carefully consider whether each sector can be split up into multiple subsectors. Not only is there a potential computational benefit of doing so, but this also allows us to explore new scenarios by setting different agent properties in each subsector. We've shown an example here involving agent objectives, but you could also modify the search space, decision rule, or even the relative demand shares of agents in multi-agent simulations (as represented by the \"Quantity\" column)."
