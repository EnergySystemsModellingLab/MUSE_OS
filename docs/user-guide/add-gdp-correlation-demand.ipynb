    "In the previous tutorial we added an exogenous service demand. That is, we explicitly specified what the demand would be per year. \n",
    "However, we may not know what the electricity demand may be per year. Instead, we may conclude that our electricity demand is a function of the GDP and population of a particular region. \n",
    "To accommodate such a scenario, MUSE enables us to choose a regression function that estimates service demands from GDP and population, which may be more certain in your case.\n",
    "In this section we will show how this can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will build off the default model that comes with MUSE. To copy the files for this model, run:\n",

    "Similarly to before, we must amend the `residential_presets` folder. As we are no longer explicitly specifying demand, we can delete the `Residential2020Consumption.csv` and `Residential2050Consumption.csv` files. Instead, we must replace these files with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __A macrodrivers file__: This contains the drivers of the service demand that we want to model. For this example, these will include GDP based on purchasing power parity (GDP PPP) and the population that we expect from 2010 to 2110.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __A regression parameters file__: This file will set the function type we would like to use to predict the service demand and the respective parameters of this regression file per region.\n",
