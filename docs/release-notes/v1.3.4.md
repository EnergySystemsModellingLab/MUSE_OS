# Release notes for MUSE v1.3.4 (March XX, 2025)

These are the main changes in MUSE v1.3.4.

## Main changes

### New `GrowthSeed` parameter (in progress)

### Growth constraint parameters are no longer mandatory ({github}`668`)

- The `MaxCapacityGrowth`, `MaxCapacityAddition` and `TotalCapacityLimit` parameters were previously mandatory when using the `max_capacity_expansion` constraint (turned on by default), leaving many users to set these parameters to very high values if they wanted effectively unbound growth.
- All three of these parameters are now optional. Omitting any of these columns from a technodata file simply means that that constraint will not apply in that sector.
- Users are encouraged to remove these columns (rather than setting extremely large values) if unbound growth is desired.
- See new documentation XXX for more details.

### Changed default `dispatch_production` method ({github}`681`)

- The default was previously "max_production" (although this was undocumented)
- This has been changed to "share"
- See new documentation here XXX

### Simplified example models (in progress)

## Bug fixes

### Allow zero interest rates ({github}`673`)

- An error was raised if interest rates in the technodata file were set to zero. This has been fixed
- See {github}`673` for more details on the bug and fix.
