# Release notes for MUSE v1.3.1 (upcoming)

These are the changes planned for the upcoming v1.3.1 (estimated December 2024).

## Planned changes

### Fix calculation of commodity prices ({github}`552`)

- There are well-known and long-standing issues with the calculation of commodity prices in MUSE, particularly commodities with a CommOut quantity not equal to 1.
- See {github}`556` for plans to address this (work in progress)

### Add a "growth seed" parameter ({github}`578`)

- A new parameter will be added which aims to fix problems initiating capacity growth for technologies with no/low existing capacity
