# Release notes for MUSE v1.3.0 (December 3, 2024)

## New `timeslice_level` parameter ({github}`550`)

- Users can now specify a timeslice level for each sector using the new `timeslice_level` parameter (for example `timeslice_level = "month"`).
- This is the level of timeslice granularity over which commodity flows out of a sector are balanced with demand. For example, a user modelling an oil sector may wish to specify that oil supply must match demand on a monthly basis, but not necessarily in every hour (as oil can be stored).
- See documentation for this parameter [here](https://muse-os.readthedocs.io/en/latest/inputs/toml.html#standard-sectors). More details can also be found at {github}`550`.
- Note: This supersedes the timeslice aggregation feature in previous versions of MUSE. If you have a `timeslices.aggregates` section in your settings file, this should be deleted, otherwise a warning will be raised.

## Default solver ({github}`587`)

- The default solver has changed to "scipy" (previously "adhoc")
- If the `lpsolver` field is left blank for any subsector, a warning will be raised and "scipy" will be used. If you wish to use the "adhoc" solver, you __must__ specify `lpsolver = "adhoc"`.
- Users are encouraged to use the "scipy" solver for all subsectors, unless memory limits are reached (see {github}`389`)

## Added support for Python 3.13 ({github}`564`)

- MUSE now works with Python versions 3.9 to 3.13
- Python 3.9 reaches its end of life [next year](https://devguide.python.org/versions/), so if you are currently using Python 3.9, now is a good opportunity to upgrade

## Bug fixes

- The processing of the `AgentShare` parameter (agents file and technodata files) has changed to enforce consistency between the two files ({github}`586`). If you receive a new `AgentShareNotDefined` error, please double check that your `AgentShare` names are consistent between your agents and techodata files. See updated documentation [here](https://muse-os.readthedocs.io/en/latest/inputs/technodata.html).

## Deprecated features

### Outputs ({github}`548`)

- The following outputs have been deleted and can no longer be used: "timeslice_supply", "metric_supply", "yearly_supply", "metricy_supply", "timeslice_consumption", "metric_consumption", "yearly_consumption", "metricy_consumption"
- Any attempt to use these outputs will raise an error
- If you need detailed supply/consumption data for any sector, please use the "supply" and "consumption" outputs within each sector, for example (replacing `SECTOR_NAME` with the name of the sector):

  ```toml
  [[sectors.SECTOR_NAME.outputs]]
  filename = '{cwd}/{default_output_dir}/{Sector}/{Quantity}.csv'
  quantity = "supply"
  sink = "aggregate"
  ```

### Production methods ({github}`557` and {github}`559`)

- The "match" and "costed" options for the `dispatch_production` parameter have been removed
- Please see [here](https://muse-os.readthedocs.io/en/latest/inputs/toml.html#standard-sectors) for updated documentation on this parameter

### The `LegacySector` class ({github}`510`)
