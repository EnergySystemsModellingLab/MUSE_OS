Techno-data
===========
The techno-data includes the techno-economic characteristics of each technology such
as capital, fixed and variable cost, lifetime, utilisation factor.
The techno-data should follow the structure reported in the table. The column order
is not important and additional input data can alsobe read in this format. In the table,
the electric boiler used in households is taken as an example for a generic region, region1.

ProcessName
   represents the technology ID and needs to be consistent across all the data inputs

RegionName
   represents the region ID and needs to be consistent across all the data inputs

Time
   represents the period of the simulation to which the value applies; it needs to
   contain at least the base year of the simulation

Level
   characterises either a fixed or a flexible input type

cap_par, cap_exp
   are used in the capital cost estimation. Capital costs are calculated as:
   
   .. math::
   
      \text{CAPEX} = \text{cap\_par} * \text{(Capacity)}^\text{cap\_exp}

   where the parameter cap_par is estimated at a selected reference size (i.e. Capref),
   such as:
   
   .. math::

      \text{cap\_par} = \left(
         \frac{\text{CAPEXref}}{\text{Capref}}
      \right)^{\text{cap\_exp}}

   Capref is decided by the modeller before filling the input data files.

   This allows the model to take into account economies of scale. ie. As `Capacity` increases, the price of the technology decreases.

fix_par, fix_exp

   are used in the fixed cost estimation. Fixed costs are calculated as:
   
   .. math::
   
      \text{FOM} = \text{fix\_par} * (\text{Capacity})^\text{fix\_exp}

   where the parameter fix_par is estimated at a selected reference size (i.e. Capref),
   such as:

   .. math::

      \text{fix\_par} = \left(
         \frac{\text{FOMref}}{\text{Capref}}
      \right)^{\text{fix\_exp}}

   Capref is decided by the modeller before filling the input data files.

var_par, var_exp
   are used in the variable costs estimation. These variable costs are capacity
   dependent Variable costs are calculated as:

   .. math::
   
      \text{VAREX} = \text{cap\_par} * \text{(Capacity)}^{\text{cap\_exp}}

   where the parameter var_par is estimated at a selected reference size (i.e. Capref),
   such as:
   
   .. math::

      \text{var\_par} = \left(
         \frac{\text{VARref}}{\text{Capref}}
      \right)^{\text{var\_exp}}

   Capref is decided by the modeller before filling the input data files.

MaxCapacityAddition
   represents the maximum addition of installed capacity per technology, region, year.

MaxCapacityGrowth
   represents the maximum growth in capacity as a fraction of the installed capacity per
   technology, region and year.

TotalCapacityLimit
   represents the total capacity limit per technology, region and year.

TechnicalLife
   represents the number of years that a technology operates before it is decommissioned.

UtilizationFactor
   is the number of operating hours of a process over the maximum number of hours in a year.    

ScalingSize
   represents the minimum size of a technology to be installed.

efficiency
   is calculated as the ratio between the total output commodities and the input commodities.

AvailabiliyYear
   defines the starting year of a technology; for example the value equals 1 when a
   technology would be available or 0 when a technology would not be available.

Type
   defines the type of a technology.     

Fuel
   defines the fuel used by a technology. 

EndUse
   defines the end use of a technology. 

InterestRate
   is the technology interest rate.

Agent_0, ..., Agent_N
   represent the allocation of the initial capacity to the each agent.
   
The input data has to be provided for the base year. Additional years within the time
framework of the overall simulation can be defined. In this case, MUSE would interpolate
the values between the provided periods and assume a constant value afterwards.
