MUSE Overview
=============

MUSE is an open source agent-based modelling environment that can be used to simulate change in an energy system over time.

MUSE is a simulation model using a “Limited foresight” approach as opposed to intertemporal optimisation models which represents the vast majority of energy systems models.

What questions can MUSE answer?
-------------------------------

MUSE can enable users to investigate how an energy system may evolve over a time period based upon investors using different decision metrics (“objectives”) such as the net present value [1], levelized cost of electricity [2] or a custom-defined function. It can also simulate how investors search for technology options, and how they may combine objectives to reach investment decisions. The search for new technologies can depend on several factors such as: agents’ budgets, technology maturity, and preferences on the fuels used.
