MUSE Overview
=============


MUSE is an open source agent-based modelling environment that can be used to simulate change in an energy system over time. An example of the type of question MUSE can help in answering is: how may a carbon budget change investments made in the power sector over the next 30 years? MUSE can incorporate residential, power, industrial and conversion sectors, meaning many questions can be asked, as per the wishes of the user.

MUSE is an agent-based modelling environment, where the agents are investors and consumers. In MUSE, this means that investment decisions are made from the point of view of the investor and consumer. These agents can be heterogenous, enabling for differering investment strategies between agents, as in the real world.

MUSE is technology rich and can model energy production, conversion and end-use technologies. So, for example, MUSE can enable the user to develop a power sector with solar photovoltaics, wind turbines and gas power plants which produce energy for appliances like electric stoves, heaters and lighting in the residential sector. Agents invest within these sectors, investing in technologies such as electric stoves in the residential sector or gas power plants in the power sectors. The investments made depend on their investment strategies.

Every sector is a user configurable module. This means that a user can configure any number of sectors, cointaining custom, user-defined technologies. In practice, this configuration is carried out using a selection of input files. In addition, MUSE can model any geographical region around the world and over any time scale, from a single year through to 100 years or more. Within a year, MUSE allows for a user-defined temporal granularity. This allows for the year to be split into different seasons and times, where energy demand may differ.

MUSE differs from the vast majority of energy systems models, which are intertemporal optimisation, by allowing agents to use "limited foresight". This enables these agents to invest under uncertainty of the future, as in the real world. In addition, MUSE is a "partial equilibrium" model, in the sense that it balances supply and demand of each energy commodity in the system.


What questions can MUSE answer?
-------------------------------

MUSE allows for users to investigate how an energy system may evolve over a time period, based upon investors using different decision metrics or objectives such as the net present value, levelized cost of electricity or a custom-defined function. In addition to this, it can simulate how investors search for technology options, and how different objectives are combined to reach an investment decision. The search for new technologies can depend on several factors such as agents' budgets, technology mutirty and preferences on the fuel-type. For instance, an investor in the power sector may decide that they want to focus on renewable energy, whereas another may prefer the perceived most profitable option.

Examples of the questions MUSE can answer include:

- `How may India's steel industry decarbonise? <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261920308072>`_

- `How might residential consumers change their investment decisions over time? <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421930177X>`_

- How might a carbon tax impact investments made in the power sector?

Of course, these are just three examples and the questions that can be answered in the energy field are diverse and varied.
