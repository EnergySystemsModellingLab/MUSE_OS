    "## Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following parts of the tutorial, we will use python to run MUSE and visualise our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach for data visualisation is to use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). Jupyter Notebook is a method of running interactive computing across dozens of programming languages. However, you are free to visualise the results using the language or program of your choice, for example Excel, R, Matlab or Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python, because MUSE is built using python, and so we can switch between running MUSE and visualisation rapidly. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to install jupyter notebook in your anaconda environment. You will need to ensure that you have a conda environment activated. If you are using the Anaconda Powershell Prompt, you will see something similar to the following if your conda environment called muse is activated:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(muse) PS C:\\Users\\my_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your environment is not activated you will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(base) PS C:\\Users\\my_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your environment is activated, you can installed Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions showed [here](https://jupyter.org/install). We will install the classic Jupyter Notebook, and so we will run the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this has been installed you can start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A web browser should now open up with a URL such as the following: ```http://localhost:8888/tree```. If it doesn't, copy and paste the command as directed in the Anaconda Powershell Prompt. This will likely take the form of:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "http://localhost:8888/?token=xxxxxxxxxx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are on the page, you will be able to navigate to a location of your choice and create a new file, by clicking the ```new``` button in the top right, followed by clicking the ```Python 3``` button.\n",
