    "In this section we run an example simulation of MUSE and visualise the results. There are a number of different examples in the source code, which can be found [here](https://github.com/EnergySystemsModellingLab/MUSE_OS/tree/main/docs/tutorial-code). Depending on [how you installed MUSE](installation/index.rst), there are two scenarios for running MUSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Running the model and then analysing the data separately**. This is available for any of the installation methods.\n",
    "- **Running the model programmatically and analysing the data in the same session**. This is only possible if MUSE was installed using a virtual environment, either as [user](installation/virtual-env-based.rst) or [developer](installation/virtual-env-based.rst).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, MUSE is run with the appropriate input arguments (either using the GUI or from the command line) and then the outputs are analysed by another tool. In the tutorials we will use Jupyter (see section below for instructions on how to install it), but you can use any data analysis tool that you are comfortable with. The second case means a closer relationship between MUSE runs and the analysis tools, being able to run MUSE within a Python script with the appropriate inputs, collecting the output and analysing the results. This approach is useful to, for example, perform a parameter sweep in MUSE."

    "```bash\n",

    "## Installing Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following parts of the tutorial, we will use Python to visualise the result of MUSE simulations. If you are not planning to use Jupyter for data analysis, just jump to the next section to learn how to run MUSE.\n",

    "A common approach for data visualisation is to use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). Jupyter Notebook is a method of running interactive computing across dozens of programming languages. However, you are free to visualise the results using the language or program of your choice, for example Excel, R, Matlab or Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you already have a Python virtual environment where you installed MUSE (see [section on virtual environments](installation/virtual-env-based.rst)), you can use the same environment for Jupyter or create a separate one. If you use the same environment, you will be able to run MUSE interactively within the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- If you did not create a virtual environment as part of your MUSE installation (you used the Standalone or pipx-based installations), you can create and activate one now (again, see [section on virtual environments](installation/virtual-env-based.rst))\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your environment is activated, you can install Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions showed [here](https://jupyter.org/install). We will install the classic Jupyter Notebook, and so we will run the following code in the terminal (if you are not familiar with the terminal, check [the appropriate section in the pipx-based installation](installation/virtual-env-based.rst)):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pip install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m jupyter jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A web browser should now open up with a URL such as the following: ```http://localhost:8888/tree```. If it doesn't, copy and paste the command as directed in the terminal. This will likely take the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "http://localhost:8888/?token=xxxxxxxxxx\n",
    "```\n",
    "With `xxxxxxxxxx` a very long collection of letters and numbers. Once you are on the page, you will be able to navigate to a location of your choice and create a new file, by clicking the ```new``` button in the top right, followed by clicking the ```Python 3``` button. You should then be able to proceed and follow the tutorials in this documentation.\n",
